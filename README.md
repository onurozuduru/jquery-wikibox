jQuery-Wikibox
==============

It is a tool that shows a short explanation of a term from Wikipedia in a tooltip box,
when user click on the text.

I forked from [here](https://github.com/fido-hh/jquery-wikipedia-tooltip),
and I have done following changes:

* replaced hover with click
* changed wikipedia API usage
* changed its style
* added title on top of the box
* added close button

**Note:** jQuery is needed to use it.
